# Phase 4: Browser Screenshot PoC (V0.4)

> **Navigation**: [Roadmap](./README.md) | [Documentation Root](../README.md)

## Purpose

Automate screenshot capture of post-submission receipt pages as proof of job application completion.

## Deliverables

1. Wallaby integration for browser automation and screenshot capture.
2. Screenshot capture workflow triggered from the Phoenix application.
3. Screenshot storage and association with job application records.
4. Tests covering screenshot capture in headless Chrome.

## Key Decision

**D2 resolved**: Wallaby (`wallaby` hex) for screenshot capture, standardized with D3 (browser automation). See [RESOLVED.md](../decisions/RESOLVED.md).

## Dependencies

- V0.1 (Project Structure) must be complete.
- Can proceed in parallel with V0.2 (PDF Write PoC).

## Status

**Not started.**
