# Phase 3: PDF Concatenation PoC (V0.3)

> **Navigation**: [Roadmap](./README.md) | [Documentation Root](../README.md)

## Purpose

Combine filled form pages and screenshot evidence into a single PDF document for submission. The compliance package should be a single file containing the populated government form and all supporting evidence.

## Deliverables

1. PDF concatenation capability in the Rust CLI tool (or as a separate subcommand).
2. Page ordering logic for form pages and evidence screenshots.
3. Integration with the Phoenix application for on-demand PDF generation.
4. Tests covering multi-page concatenation and image-to-PDF conversion.

## Dependencies

- V0.2 (PDF Write PoC) must be complete.

## Status

**Not started.**
