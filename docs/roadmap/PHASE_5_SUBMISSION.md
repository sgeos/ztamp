# Phase 5: Submission Logic (V0.5)

> **Navigation**: [Roadmap](./README.md) | [Documentation Root](../README.md)

## Purpose

Implement per-platform job application submission workflows. Each job board or employer site may have different form structures and submission flows.

## Deliverables

1. Platform-specific submission modules (one per supported job board).
2. Wallaby-based browser automation for form interaction.
3. Human-in-the-loop support for CAPTCHAs and manual steps.
4. Submission result capture (success, failure, requires follow-up).
5. Integration with screenshot capture (V0.4) for proof of submission.

## Key Decision

**D3 resolved**: Wallaby for human-in-the-loop browser automation. See [RESOLVED.md](../decisions/RESOLVED.md).

## Dependencies

- V0.4 (Browser Screenshot PoC) must be complete.

## Status

**Not started.**
