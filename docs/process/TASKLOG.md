## Task Breakdown

| ID | Task | Status | Verification |

## Notes

- Work item coding uses Px-Ty format (Prompt-Task) adapted from the blog project Ax-Py-Tz system. The article dimension was removed because this is not a blog.
- The crypto project uses Vw-Mx-Py-Tz. This was considered but deemed unnecessarily complex for the current project scope.
- PROMPT.md was authored by the human pilot and is committed as-is per the communication protocol.

## History

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-02-19 | P1: Knowledge graph, process documentation, CLAUDE.md, git strategy, communication protocol, and .gitignore established. |
