# Current Prompt

## Comments

Grid cells are not square.
Y labels at the bottom of the page are only half visible.

- Last X gridline is labelled x210.
- Last Y gridline is labelled y270.

This form has a landscape orientation that is rotated 90 degrees CCW.
I get the feeling that there is a false assumption somewhere.

Answers to questions in the reverse prompt.

1. Grid lines and labels are visible and useful,
   but grid does not appear to be correct.
   `--grid 5` will probably better.
2. Need to fix the grid before calibration makes sense.
3. No need to sweep.

## Objectives

### Revise Fill Tool

Attempt to adjust fill tool to correct the grid logic based on the above feedback.

It is OK to use the same filename.
