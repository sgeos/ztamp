# Current Prompt

## Comments

We will now refine the process.

Answers to questions.

1. Use `Vw-Mx-Py-Tz` coding.
2. Use trunk-based development with feature branches following the crypto convention.
3. The crypto project has files for documenting and resolving blockers.
   We need that process for this project.
4. `.gitkeep` is a good idea.

## Objectives

### Adopt Coding

Adopt task coding structure from the crypto project.
I think it is `Vw-Mx-Py-Tz`.

- `/Users/bsechter/projects/crypto/cordial_cantina`

Update the knowledge graph.

### Adopt Trunk Based Development

Use trunk-based development with feature branches following the crypto convention.
Document this in the knowledge graph.

### Adopt Trunk Based Development

The crypto project has files for documenting and resolving blockers.
We need that process for this project.
Document PDF manipulation, screenshot capture, and browser automation as blocking decisions.
Include recommendations in your next reverse prompt.
Feel free to research options.

### Add .gitkeep to Secret Folder

Add `.gitkeep` to the `secret` folder.

### Whitelist Example Files

Whitelist `*.example` files in `.gitignore`.
This will allow `.example` files the `secret` folder to show up in the repo.
It will also allow the `*.example` files to document needed settings.

## Context

To meet my TANF requirements,
I will need to look for a job for 30 hours per week.
The problem is that this needs to be documented on
a government form that was distributed to me as a PDF.
I also need to include a screenshot of the post-submission
receipt page after every submission.
I therefore need an automate solution for applying to jobs
and tracking application.

## Constraints

We absolutely need to work with the supplied government PDF.
This PDF should not be included in the git repo.

## Success Criteria

- Document use of `Vw-Mx-Py-Tz` coding.
- Document use of trunk-based development with feature branches following the crypto convention.
- Add files to track blockers and decisions to the knowledge graph.
  Add these blockers to those files:
  PDF manipulation, screenshot capture, and browser automation
- Include recommendations for blocker resolutions in your next reverse prompt.
- Add `.gitkeep` to the `secret` folder.
- Whitelist `*.example` files in `.gitignore`.

## Notes

I would like the tech stack to be Phoenix/Elixir with Liveview,
and a Rust NIF for number crunching and modify in place algorithms.
If custom command line tools are needed, they can be written in Rust.
