# Current Prompt

## Comments

Answers to questions in the reverse prompt.

1. I am pretty sure Chromedriver has been installed.
2. Form time_in should autopopulate with the current local time.
   time_out should have a checkmark that checked by default "use submisssion time."
   - If checked, the field is greyed out and not selectable.
   - If unchecked, a time can be entered manually.
   - Either way, use local time.
3. Screenshots need to be tested before V0.4 is complete.
