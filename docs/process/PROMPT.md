# Current Prompt

## Comments

Answers to questions in the reverse prompt.

1. Grid cells appear to be square.
   Dimensions appear to be about 279 or 280 and 211 or 212.
2. I think it would make sesne to stretch X offsets,
   and squash Y offsets according to the new coordinate system.
   I think it will have to manually adjust from there.

## Objectives

### Revise Field Offsets

Revise field offsets.
According to the new coordinate system:

- Stretch X offsets.
- Squash Y offsets.

### Repeat Calibaration Test

Repeat calibration test for the next iteration of form output.
It is OK to use the same filename.
