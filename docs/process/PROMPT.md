# Current Prompt

## Comments

Answers to questions in the reverse prompt.

1. Combined PDF is acceptable.
2. Page order is acceptable.
3. V0.3 is complete.

## Objectives

### Merge V0.3 Into Main

Merge V0.3 into main.

#### Start V0.4

The V0.4 goal is some sort of workflow that allows Wallaby to perform screen captures.
If it can attach to a running browser window, this is ideal.
If not, it will need to launch a browser it can use to capture screenshots.
There should be a page that allows me to fill out details for project application rows,
along with a button to take a screenshot.

When the button is pressed:

- A screenshot is saved in a subdirectory in secrets.
- A database entry including the form information and the screenshot
  are stored in the database.
