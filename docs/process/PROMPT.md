## Objectives

### Merge V0.1 Branch Into Main

Merge V0.1 branch into main.

### Attempt V0.2 PoC

- Put portable logic in `rztamp`.
- Generate a Rust-based CLI tool that can fill out all fields.
  - `printpdf` based.
  - CLI tool repo lives in `tools`. New project that pulls in `rztamp` as a dependency.
  - Colored text can be printed.
- Use tool to generate sample output file in `secret`.
  - Use red text for non-job search fields.
  - Circle all options.
  - Alternate between blue and magenta for job search rows.
  - Output should not overwrite existing files.
